#### Hello fellow wanna-be terms of service violators! This is a repo to help you better understand the Akamai antibot system...
If there is something I did wrong or you think something could be improved, pull request I would love to update this!

**Note #1:** *This is not a "FREE UNBANNED AKAMAI GENERATOR!!!11!!1" It is learning resource that happens to have a generator that I feel best demonstrates the concepts included in the pdf.*
 
**Note #2:** *Code is bad and messy and I did not know what I was doing. Update coming soon...*
